Network configuration

1. Core Network Design
Layer 2 (Switching)
1.	Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):
o	Protocol: Use Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) for faster convergence.
o	Root Bridge: Assign the core switch (Cisco Catalyst 9200-24P) as the root bridge. Configure it with a lower priority (e.g., spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096) to ensure it becomes the root.
o	Port Roles: Identify root, designated, and blocking ports to prevent loops.
o	PortFast: Enable on edge ports to reduce startup time for end-user devices.
o	BPDU Guard: Enable on edge ports to protect against rogue switches.
2.	VLAN Segmentation:
o	Departments: Create VLANs to segment traffic:
	VLAN 10: Management
	VLAN 20: Finance
	VLAN 30: HR
	VLAN 40: IT
	VLAN 50: Guest Wi-Fi
	VLAN 60: IoT Devices
o	Inter-VLAN Routing: Configure SVI (Switch Virtual Interfaces) on the core switch for routing between VLANs.
3.	Trunking:
o	Use 802.1Q for VLAN tagging.
o	Allow only necessary VLANs on trunk ports to reduce unnecessary traffic.


Layer 3 (Routing)
1.	Routing Protocols:
o	EIGRP:
	Use EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) within the corporate LAN for dynamic routing.
	Configure EIGRP on the core switch and router:
router eigrp 100
network 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
passive-interface default
no passive-interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
	Use Summarization at major boundaries (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16) to reduce routing table size.
o	BGP:
	Configure Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for internet peering with the ISP.
	Use the router as the BGP speaker:
router bgp 65001
neighbor 203.0.113.1 remote-as 65002
network 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0
2.	Default Route:
o	Advertise a default route to EIGRP from the core switch pointing toward the internet router:
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.254
redistribute static



3.	Redundancy:
o	Use HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) or VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) for gateway redundancy.
________________________________________
2. QoS (Quality of Service)
1.	Classification:
o	Classify traffic based on DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) values:
	VoIP: EF (Expedited Forwarding, DSCP 46)
	Video: AF41 (Assured Forwarding)
	Default: Best Effort (DSCP 0)
2.	Policy Application:
o	Configure Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) on the router to prioritize VoIP and video traffic:
class-map match-any VOICE
  match dscp ef
policy-map QOS_POLICY
  class VOICE
    priority 50
  class class-default
    fair-queue
interface GigabitEthernet1/0
  service-policy output QOS_POLICY




________________________________________
3. WAN Configuration
1.	Internet Connection:
o	Dual-homed connections to two ISPs for redundancy.
o	Configure BGP with route preference (Local Preference and AS Path) to ensure one ISP is primary and the other is failover.
2.	VPN:
o	Use IPSec VPN for remote users:
	Encryption: AES-256.
	Authentication: Pre-shared keys or certificates.
________________________________________
4. IP Addressing Plan
•	Subnetting: Efficiently divide the 192.168.0.0/16 block:
o	VLAN 10 (Management): 192.168.10.0/24
o	VLAN 20 (Finance): 192.168.20.0/24
o	VLAN 30 (HR): 192.168.30.0/24
o	VLAN 40 (IT): 192.168.40.0/24
o	VLAN 50 (Guest Wi-Fi): 192.168.50.0/24
o	VLAN 60 (IoT Devices): 192.168.60.0/24
________________________________________
5. Network Security Enhancements
1.	ACLs:
o	Apply Ingress ACLs on VLAN interfaces to restrict inter-VLAN traffic:
access-list 100 permit tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80
access-list 100 deny ip any any


Apply on the interface:
interface Vlan10
  ip access-group 100 in
2.	Route Filtering:
o	Prevent BGP from advertising private IP addresses to the ISP.
3.	Port Security:
o	Configure port security on access ports:
switchport port-security
switchport port-security maximum 2
switchport port-security violation restrict
4.	DHCP Snooping:
o	Enable DHCP Snooping to block rogue DHCP servers.
________________________________________
6. Final Testing and Validation
1.	EIGRP Validation:
o	Verify EIGRP neighbors using:
show ip eigrp neighbors
2.	BGP Validation:
o	Check BGP neighbors and advertised routes:
show ip bgp summary
3.	STP Validation:
o	Confirm root bridge and port states:
show spanning-tree vlan 10



4.	Performance Testing:
o	Use iPerf for bandwidth testing between VLANs.
o	Run simulated traffic to test QoS policies.

Diagram (Optional if needed):
A topology diagram can be designed in Cisco Packet Tracer or Visio, showcasing:
•	Core switch as the central point.
•	Routers for WAN and BGP connections.
•	VLAN segmentation.
This design ensures scalability, high performance, and secure communication across the network while adhering to CCNP-level best practices.
